# CSC 496 - Module 6

Purpose: Add a folder called 'docker' to your git repo. Inside docker, create a Dockerfile that uses the official nginx web server as a base image. (hint: https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx ) In your docker file mount or copy the gnuplot png into the docker container. Then load your browser at http://localhost:port/your_graph.png and save a screenshot in the 'docker' folder. Commit and push your git repo to github.

This was fairly simple to do and I enjoyed using docker the most because of it. The examples given in the text were easy to follow along and implement my own work into. 

I have put each game into it's own folder and each seperate Dockerfile along with a Dockerfile implemenation file explaining how I ran everything in Git and Docker.
