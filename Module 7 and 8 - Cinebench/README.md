# CSC 496 - Module 7 and 8

Purpose: Create an Auto-hotkey script that will run a benchmark Cibnebench R23 on your computer. Save a screenshot of the result (screenshot.png or screenshot.jpg or screenshot.bmp) , and export the single and multi core scores to a text file. Add the autohotkey script to your repository. Write a simple powershell test to check the contents of your Cinebench score script.

I think Cinebench was fairly easy to use. The only issue I had was creating Auto-hotkey scripts to run everything at once. It was pretty tricky but I eventually figured it out.
