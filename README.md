# CSC 496 Assignment for module 3.
This is the data text files for my raid shadow league game.
I honestly picked this game after a quick google search of free PC games considering I don't play any PC games although I would like to start. 
Comparing my data with the professors, I think that GPU on my computer is not very efficent enough to display and monitor heavily graphiced games. 
I think this because my GPU wasn't able to monitor on the MSI afterburner and didn't even run correctly on my laptop that I use for school. 
I had to only use the HWiNFO app to log my data in an excel sheet. 
The laptop I tested is an HP laptop 15-dy1xxxx with a graphics card of Intel(R) UHD Graphics.
To be completely honest I haven't participated much in playing PC games or researching the best laptops with the best graphics to play them on, so I am a little uneducated in this subject.
