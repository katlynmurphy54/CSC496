# CSC 496 - Module 3 and 4
Purpose: Pick two 3d accelerated games gather some performance data from those games using tools like MSI Afterburner, HWInfo64 and any built-in benchmarks the game has. Create a folder for each game in your git repo and add the text files there of the game performance. Try to capture at least: CPU temperature, GPU temperature, cpu clock speed, GPU clock speed (memory clock and core clock if you have both options), frame time and frame rate.

I decided to collect data from the games GTA2, total domination, and raid shadow league game with the tool HWInfo64.
I honestly picked these games after a quick google search of free PC games considering I don't have much time on my hands to play games. 
Comparing my data with the professors, I think the GPU on my computer is not very efficent enough to display and monitor heavily graphiced games.
I think this because my GPU wasn't able to monitor on the MSI afterburner and didn't even run correctly on my laptop that I use for school.
I had to only use the HWiNFO app to log my data in an excel sheet.
The laptop I tested is an HP laptop 15-dy1xxxx with a graphics card of Intel(R) UHD Graphics.
To be completely honest I haven't participated much in playing PC games or researching the best laptops with the best graphics to play them on, so I am a little uneducated in this subject.
