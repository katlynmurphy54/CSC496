Purpose: Setup GNU Plot plot files that plot the framerates for each run of each game. Ideally each game is graphed separately, but each result from each game is graphed together.

It was a little difficult for me at first to figure out how to graph the data from my games in Module 3 and 4 in GNUPlot. I think this is due to the way I stored my data in the excel sheet. It was alot of data that I had to cypher through just to plot the framerates of each game. However, there were available resources online to help me figure out my solutions and plot my graph's correctly.
