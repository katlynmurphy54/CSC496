#CSC 496 - MODULE 10. 

Purpose: Create a github pages site that contains an html version of the output of the assignment from #9. This will probably need to be in another repo because of how github pages work. 

The repository to access my GitHub pages is located on my github profile here: https://github.com/katlynmurphy54/katlynmurphy54.github.io

To access the GitHub page directly simply type 'katlynmurphy54.github.io' into your web browser. 

There you will see the graphs greated in Module 9 based on the specific benchmark results for the various games played in different resolutions.
