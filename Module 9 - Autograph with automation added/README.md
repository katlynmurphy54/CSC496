# CSC 496 - Module 9 - AutoGraph 

Purpose: Write a script in the language of your choice to extract the benchmarks from these folders and graph them by game and GPU. So for example Borderlands 3 is tested at 3 different resolutions on both GPUs. The output of your program should generate an image for each Game and in the image is a graph of the frame rate. Ideally the graph would show the average framerate and show what the 1% and .1% lows were overall.

I think graphing these were much simplier than grpahing my own data just for the simple fact it was much more organized than mine. Also, after learning different ways to write scripts this made it easier rather than being tied down to only knowing how to write a script oen way.
