# CSC 496 - Module 9 - AutoGraph 

Purpose: Write a script in the language of your choice to extract the benchmarks from these folders and graph them by game and GPU. So for example Borderlands 3 is tested at 3 different resolutions on both GPUs. The output of your program should generate an image for each Game and in the image is a graph of the frame rate. Ideally the graph would show the average framerate and show what the 1% and .1% lows were overall.
